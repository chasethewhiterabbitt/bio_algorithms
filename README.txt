These algorithms sort through genetic information to find patterns in the data.

BIO_ALGORITHMSI:

Input - string called text (genomic information), an integer k, l length of txt

Algorithm - Uses the input to create a list of
every k sized string, called that value a kmer, 
and put into a list with kmers and frequencies

Output - The kmer with the highest frequency, can be multiple answers 


BIO_ALGORITHMSII:

- Depending on the genome itself, codes that are "reverse complements"
of another can hold the same value/meaning/message, this program find the 
reverse complement of another string

-INPUT: - a genome string (preferably a kmer) 
if 500 char are input, it will print 500

Algo: first functions reverses the order of a string
the second function prints complement
i.e. 'A' for 'T' and 'C' for 'G' and vice versa
