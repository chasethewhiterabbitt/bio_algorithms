These algorithms sort through genetic information to find patterns in the data.

bio_algoritmsI:

Input - string called text (genomic information), an integer k, l length of txt

Algorithm - Uses the input to create a list of
every k sized string, called that value a kmer, 
and put into a list with kmers and frequencies

Output - The kmer with the highest frequency, can be multiple answers 


and bio_algorithmsII sort through the data to find probable 
locations of DnaA box, the origin of replication.

Your mind is software, program it
Your body is a shell, change it
